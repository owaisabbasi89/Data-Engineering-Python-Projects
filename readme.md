# ETL Python Projects Repository

Welcome to the ETL Python Projects repository! This repository contains individual Python projects, each demonstrating a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Project:**
   - Navigate to the desired project folder.
   - Download the `.py` file associated with the project.

2. **Run the Project:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the project folder.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     python project_filename.py
     ```
     Replace `project_filename.py` with the actual name of the downloaded Python file.

3. **View Results:**
   - The project will execute the complete ETL pipeline, and relevant output files or results will be generated in the project folder.

That's it! You've successfully run the ETL pipeline for the selected project.

## Note
- Each project is designed to showcase a specific ETL process.
- Running the Python file will automatically create any necessary files or output associated with the project.
